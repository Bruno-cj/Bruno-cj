### Welcome to Bruno Ugolini's Github page!

I am a Data Scientist recently graduated from the Data Science Diploma program at Concordia University.

I put a lot of effort into my Final Project to showcase the type of analytical work I enjoy doing. Please [check it out here!](https://github.com/Bruno-cj/Final_Project) (I also made a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16a48c6xCm47fHgQGPWE0EGm3IE5DC4qf/view?usp=sharing) of the final product if you're in a hurry)

Much of my [professional career](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunougolini/) has been in the early phases of technology development. That's probably where this penchant for original thinking was nurtured.

As I work on new projects, I shall be updating this page.

Cheers and thanks for visiting!
